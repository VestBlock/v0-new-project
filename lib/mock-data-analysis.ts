/**
 * This file identifies and documents all sources of mock data in the VestBlock application
 * to help eliminate them systematically.
 */

// Sources of mock data in the current implementation:

// 1. Explicit fallback mechanisms in OpenAI service files
// - lib/openai-credit-analyzer.ts: Uses fallbackToMock parameter
// - lib/openai-enhanced.ts: Contains generateMockAnalysis function
// - lib/openai-service.ts: Has fallback logic when API calls fail

// 2. Cached responses that might contain mock data
// - The caching mechanism doesn't distinguish between real and mock data
// - Once mock data is cached, it continues to be served even if OpenAI becomes available

// 3. Conditional logic in API routes
// - app/api/analyze-credit/route.ts: Has fallback logic
// - app/api/analyze/route.ts: Contains similar fallback patterns
// - app/api/credit-chat/route.ts: Falls back to generic responses on failure

// 4. Frontend components that handle API failures with mock content
// - components/credit-chat.tsx: Creates fallback messages
// - app/credit-analysis/page.tsx: Has DEFAULT_ANALYSIS_DATA for when data is missing

// 5. Database persistence of mock data
// - Once mock data is stored in the analyses table, it's retrieved and displayed
// - No mechanism to flag or refresh analyses that contain mock data
